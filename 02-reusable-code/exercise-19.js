/*
 * Create a function called getHeaderLinkMarkup( title, url ) that takes a title and a url.  Inside the
 * function create a variable called link that gets the value of getMyLinkMarkup( title, url ) with the
 * title and URL passed to it.  Then create a variable called header and set it equal to the
 * getMyHeaderMarkup() with the link variable passed into it instead of normal text.  Finally return
 * the value of link.  Console log getHeaderLinkMarkup() with a title and a url passed to it to test.
